# API Testing Project

In the current project I test the Simple Book API using two different approach:
-	Testing API with Postman (dedicated GUI application for API testing purpose) and JavaScript for writing tests.
-	Testing API with Python and itâ€™s library Requests (dedicated Python library for API testing)
